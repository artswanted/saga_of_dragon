Dragon Fellowship is a group of special elite heroes to prevent another war such as the one happened 50 years ago since dragon&#39;s trace has been found in Tower of Truth.

I can write a recommendation for you if you want! I&#39;m quite close to him. How&#39;s that sound?"/>

You know that there was a huge war between Human and Dragons about 50 years ago, don&#39;t you?%%
The war was over after the &#39;sealing&#39; of Dark Lord Elga and General Blood into the &#39;Shadow Cabinet&#39;, but recently, Elga has been released!!%%
Accordingly, Continent of the Wind is now in big trouble. As you can see, monsters have rushed into Odellia. %%
So, to save our continent, we gathered elite heroes and made the Dragon Fellowship. 
You...you didn&#39;t asked me about the Fellowship to join, did you? With that...pathetic body of yours???%%
To join, you have to meet Captain Colin in Port of the Wind, and 
in our town, you have to get Dustin&#39;s recommendation letter!%%
This means only a selected few get to enlist.%%
Ah. Sorry for talking so much, but...a %%
%class% like you traveled far to get here, so why don&#39;t you take a load off your mind, and feet, and relax in the Inn of our town for a while?%% I will introduce you!"/>
	<TEXT ID="501230" Text="Yes, that is a good idea.
You can find the Inn if you go to your right.
I&#39;ll introduce you to {C=0xFF016295/}Innkeeper Florence{C=0xFF4D0D08/}, so stay there for a while and relax.%%
You should observe the situation around here. You can {C=0xFF016295/}hit &#39;N&#39; and use the mouse cursor to find Florence, or find her via the red question mark{C=0xFF4D0D08/}. %%
Well, hope you have a wonderful journey. "/>

If you head to your right, you&#39;ll see the {C=0xFF016295/}Inn{C=0xFF4D0D08/} and you&#39;ll meet {C=0xFF4D0D08/}Innkeeper Florence{C=0xFF4D0D08/}.
You can rest there.%%
And if you have nothing to do, just {C=0xFF016295/}press L and you can check Quest Information{C=0xFF4D0D08/}. It will be helpful to you%%
Have a nice day."/>

It&#39;s still too dangerous outside, so stay at our village for a little while.

I remember hearing that you were here to apply for the {C=0xFF016295/}Dragon Fellowship{C=0xFF4D0D08/}.
I hear that only the elite few will be selected though...%%

Since you are a foreigner, you probably don&#39;t know that the {C=0xFF016295/}Continent of Wind{C=0xFF4D0D08/} is now in chaos due to the resurrection of {C=0xFF016295/}Elga{C=0xFF4D0D08/} who disobeyed the {C=0xFF016295/}Dragon Lord{C=0xFF4D0D08/}!%%
The dreadful {C=0xFF016295/}Elga{C=0xFF4D0D08/} might throw the world of mankind into the world of darkness once again like before. So I am helping heroes who have applied for the {C=0xFF016295/}Dragon Fellowship{C=0xFF4D0D08/} who can face {C=0xFF016295/}Elga{C=0xFF4D0D08/} according to the prophecy of the {C=0xFF016295/}Dragon Lord{C=0xFF4D0D08/}.%%

You can disassemble the item with the hammer icon on the bottom of the inventory window. Now click the hammer icon and then the item with the soulforce!%%
Now you have a Soul!
It will be helpful to have enough souls with you because it can add more functions and attributes to your item.%% 
Also you can remove seals from items like what Julie said. Enough explanation?"/>

I am the secretary of the Dragon Lord! I&#39;m called by the glorious name Pororing!.%%
From now on, I&#39;ll tell you the reason why I came here to meet you, so please listen carefully%%
Do you know of the {C=0xFF016295/}Dragon Lord{C=0xFF4D0D08/} by any chance? Well, you will never know.
He predicted that I will be able to meet the hero who would save the {C=0xFF016295/}Continent of Wind{C=0xFF4D0D08/} here. You might not know, but the {C=0xFF016295/}Continent of Wind{C=0xFF4D0D08/} is in chaos because you came from a country village. I mean from the resurrection of Elga {C=0xFF016295/}who had disobeyed the will of {C=0xFF016295/}the Dragon Lord{C=0xFF4D0D08/} who is the dragon of dragons!%%
{C=0xFF016295/}Elga{C=0xFF4D0D08/} might throw the human world into the world of darkness without light like he did before. That&#39;s why the {C=0xFF016295/}Dragon Lord{C=0xFF4D0D08/} came to this world to find the foretold hero who can battle with {C=0xFF016295/}Elga{C=0xFF4D0D08/}!%%
You know what I&#39;m saying now, right?
So you are the chosen hero. The hero chosen by the secretary of Dragon Lord.%%
Well! Anyway I want to be born again as the right hand of the Dragon Lord by raising a great hero who would be able to seal up Elga again.%%
Let&#39;s go to the nearest village first. Try moving forward by pressing the {C=0xFF016295/}right arrow on the keyboard{C=0xFF4D0D08/}!"/>

	<TEXT ID="505822" Text="Oh~ so you&#39;ve attained the {C=0xFF016295/}Enchant Powder{C=0xFF4D0D08/}!!%%
Oh! Okay. I&#39;m saying this because you have acquired Enchant Powder, but there is more important information that is necessary for battle!
That&#39;s because you can {C=0xFF016295/}upgrade{C=0xFF4D0D08/} items through various methods in this world%%
The first method is with the Enchant Dust you have acquired just now! You can {C=0xFF016295/}enchant{C=0xFF4D0D08/} equipments through the {C=0xFF016295/}Blacksmith{C=0xFF4D0D08/} who is around the village!%%
Hmm, while this is the method which is most commonly used, if you have weapon reinforcement powder, they will raise attributes to your weapon and armor.%% 
As I told you before, Meet the Blacksmith, press {C=0xFF016295/}Enchant{C=0xFF4D0D08/} and place the equipment you want to upgrade on the Enchant window. Then if you press Enchant button, you will be able to enchant equipments very easily!%%
And for the second method, there is a method of improving basic attributes (power, intelligence, agility, health) of equipment using {C=0xFF016295/}Soulcraft{C=0xFF4D0D08/} from Julie.%%
Because it would give you a headache to know both of these methods on this Soulcraft, I will teach you the Enchant first.! How about that? Was I kind?%% 
Hey, consider yourself lucky that you met a helper like me!! (It&#39;s obvious how you would have been if I wasn&#39;t here!)%%
Well, then let&#39;s proceed~~"/>
	<TEXT ID="505823" Text="Nice!! You were successful with Enchant. Then I&#39;ll tell you how to upgrade equipments through Soulcraft this time! Ahem!%%
Soulcraft is something that adds power to the whole item such as  grade or soul force of the item!%% To tell you only the core of the method of Soul crafting!%% Split the hammer with soul force attached in my bag and make it into soul. Then Soulcraft through Julie who is around the village! %%
All right??
Hmm.......Talk slowly?%%
I knew it~ Hew~ Okay! I&#39;ll teach you slowly so listen carefully
First you can open up your inventory through I key. An inventory stands for a bag.(You know that much, right...?) %%
If you look carefully among your items in the inventory, items with soul force attached exist.
How do you check the soul force?%%
If you open the inventory and place the mouse pointer near the item, An explanation (Tooltip) on that item pops up~
Do you see it?%% Yes, you can check the soul force of the item there%%
Let&#39;s see! Now you can disassemble items with soul using hammer icon at the bottom of inventory window with an item that has this soul force  attached (Right below Inventory and not the Skill button!)%% 
After that, you would be finding Julie who is a pretty girl in the village through this soul.%%There~Now just like having enchanted, press Use Soulcraft, place desired equipment above Soulcraft window and press OK. Now the Soulcraft is complete%%
You understand for sure now, right?%% Seeing is believing! You will know if you try it yourself. So let&#39;s go find Julie if you want to try it!"/>

That&#39;s right, parties here are something where you and your companions join together and fight together as well as share the treasure you find.
If you like someone you&#39;ve partied with, go ahead and make them your friend!
It&#39;s not easy making good friends you know!%%

	<TEXT ID="523307" Text="Spiritual Drop simply means &#34;stone containing magical elements.&#34;%%
Thousand of years ago, the heroes concealed the fearsome Black Dragon Lord Elga using spiritual drops containing unique magical elements.%% 
Our great God EA created spiritual drops using natural energy resources such as Water, Fire, Wind, Earth, Light, and Darkness and hid them all over the world.%%
Alchemists in old days conducted research on the power of spiritual drops under the great god&#39;s guidance, and eventually figured out various magics.%%
However, spiritual drops did not bring good parts alone. Monsters that earned magical elements from spiritual drops were spotted.%%The magical elements from spiritual drops can be classified as Element Attack and Element Resistance.%% 
Using Weapon having Element Attack applied onto, it is easy to defeat the monsters having low Element Resistance.%% 
On the other hand, equipping armors having counter-element resistance applied onto, damage from monsters can be reduced dramatically.%% 
Be careful with element choice.%%
If you hold weapon having Fire Element Attack and attack the monster having high Fire Element Resistance, it will make the battle harder.%%
In order to obtain magical elements, you will have to gain its base ingredient which are the spiritual drops from the monsters in the Dungeon of Spirits."/>
