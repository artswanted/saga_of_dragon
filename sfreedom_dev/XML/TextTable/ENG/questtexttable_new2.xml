Oh! please! believe me. I am not insane!%%
This is the tenth time I introduce myself. Once I said &#34;other dimension&#34; people just leave.
Please listen to my story.%%
Our world, Rune Midgarts, especially in {C=0xFF016295/}Geffen{C=0xFF4D0D08/}, we have faced a disaster. It was ten years ago, some energy mass came through the dimensional barrier to {C=0xFF016295/}Geffen{C=0xFF4D0D08/}.
For now we just call the energy mass {C=0xFF00863C/}the energy{C=0xFF4D0D08/}.%%
Because of the energy, monsters got mutated, and it has been hard to fight them.
That&#39;s why I came to this world to find someone to save us...But ever since when I say I am from other dimension, people make a funny face and turn away.%%

{C=0xFF00863C/}(...){C=0xFF4D0D08/}%%
Anyway, besides the mutated monsters, we have dimensional vortex in our world.
This is a conflict that occurs when the energy from other dimension and the repulsive force of our world crashes the dimensional barriers.%%
In {C=0xFF016295/}Geffen{C=0xFF4D0D08/}, many places have been restricted.
That&#39;s not all. {C=0xFF00863C/}Dr. Kaluza{C=0xFF4D0D08/} and Extremists believe that the energy is an attack from other dimension. And their idea is against  {C=0xFF00863C/}Dr. Klein{C=0xFF4D0D08/} and Moderates who believe the energy is a random disaster.%%

According to Gwen, entering the {C=0xFF016295}Dungeon of Spirits{C=0xFF4D0D08/} without having a special item is dangerous. Since there is a concentrated amount of energy from spirits in the {C=0xFF016295}Dungeon of Spirits{C=0xFF4D0D08/}, it can hurt those that enter. With the {C=0xFFFF0000}Protection from Spirits Stone{C=0xFF4D0D08/}, people can block the damage. But {C=0xFFFF0000}Protection from Spirits Stone{C=0xFF4D0D08/} consumes one&#39;s spiritual strength, the maximum use is 4 times a day.

In the past, several unprepared people have lost their lives after entering the {C=0xFF016295}Dungeon of Spirits{C=0xFF4D0D08/}.%%

That&#39;s why the {C=0xFFFF0000}Protection from Spirits Stone{C=0xFF4D0D08/} has been created. 
{C=0xFFFF0000}Protection from Spirits Stone{C=0xFF4D0D08/} is a Protection Stone made of concentrated spirit energy.

Vartika Hill - Croquis

{T=FTcts_13/C=0xFFA62700/}[Detail]{T=QTtext/C=0xFF4D0D08/}
The reason Croquis came to {C=0xFF016295}Vartika Hill{C=0xFF4D0D08/} was to find Dragon Egg. Vargons and Hill Gnolls have never been close but these days they are working together seeking something. Croquis found this very odd, so that he asked for help to find a clue what they are after. For {C=0xFF00863C}Dragonkin Adventurer Croquis{C=0xFF4D0D08/}, defeat 30 {C=0xFFFF5917}Vatican Scout monsters{C=0xFF4D0D08/}."/>

As you helped my friend,
I do not know how to appreciate your kindness.%%
Honestly speaking, I have been Kazeura Village due to Priest Horn Ochukoe&#39;s summon. Ochukoe assigned me a special secret mission.%%
That is to bring a Dragon Egg.%%
In this world, we still have baby dragons, but these days nobody has witnessed huge dragons.%%
And Ochukoe&#39;s pet baby dragon Koop said he can feel Dragon Egg is in the east part of the hill.
Can I go on?"/>

However, I sensed something odd.
Vargons and Hill Gnoll have never been close. But I witnessed they were moving along together.%%
It seems that they were seeking something...very important. If we go after them, we may find a key. It is just I need a hand.
Please do me a favor. Throw them into confusions while I investigate for clue.%%

The boarding pass are being trade very expensively among people.%%
