I&#39;m Dr. Nicola and this is Metro City. %%
I&#39;ve been conducting my studies regarding dimension shifting.%%
The machine next to me makes passage between dimensions possible.%%
For some reasons, right after opening the dimensional passage, the Jojo Bros Gang from Metro City stole the Wave Stabilizer which is a vital component.%%
Without this component, the dimensional passage cannot be closed.%%
I would hypothesise that the passage has been open for too long and a dimensional distortion occurred, opening a portal in Dragonica as well.%%"/>
