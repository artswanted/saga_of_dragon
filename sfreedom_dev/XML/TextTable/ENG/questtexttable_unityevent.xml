Hello {C=0xFF016295/}%name%{C=0xFF4D0D08/}!
Nice to meet you. I am your Certificate Manager Edward. It's now more than one year ago since players from all around the world came together to play on this server. We want to celebrate this and welcome you to the {C=0xFFA03030/}Players of the World Unite!{C=0xFF4D0D08/} Event.%%
Please walk over to the Cake and have a little talk. The Cake will provide you with some quests which may would be worth doing. Just a little hint from myself. I'm sure we will meet again the day you bring your event certificates back to me to exchange them for something nice.%%
I am looking forward to see you again, but know it's time to head over to the Cake."/>

I've got a little surprise left for you. Take this 250 pieces of the Cake he gave me for you and this little reward from me for all your effort.%%
