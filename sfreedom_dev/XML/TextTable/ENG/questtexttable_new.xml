Do you remember what I said when I met you for the first time?
That I said it seems like someone provoked Hookah and Alvida.%%
The fact that Hookah and Alvida showed up at the port all the sudden, and because of the fact that they attacked into this Port of the Wind which they know for sure that it is known to be closely guarded.%%
When I questioned their followers, there was someone behind it as I expected.
Do you know who is behind it?%%
If you are thinking the same thing, you are right.
A witch in a black robe showed up at their ship and came up with a huge sack filled with money.%%
Then they said they were told to only make threats around this Port of the Wind without asking why.
Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s strange? Telling only to threaten the Port of the Wind without attacking.%%

Farrell&#39;s house is a very complicated area and Farrell&#39;s room is made up of very sturdy steel door.%%
According to the information by the patrol who have raided that place to find out what he is doing, they say you need five keys to go into Farrell&#39;s room.%%
I heard that the keys are hidden in the bodies of those monsters one by one as Farrell was doing experiment on strong monsters that he had caught.%%
Why do you think Farrell had divided up those keys like that to plant them where he can&#39;t even find?
Wouldn&#39;t there surely be something fishy?%%
Farrell know the secret code recorded in that door and passing through with it, but because it seems like a spare key in case the secret code doesn&#39;t work, you should find that key first and make s surprise attack on Farrell.%%
The keys with 5 characteristics are hidden here and there inside Farrell&#39;s mansion.. Please be careful finding that place because it is complicated just like the Maze. "/>

In a situation where we are busy just with this problem, there is a report that notorious Hookah and Alvida couple showed up around the port recently.%%
Although we were restless with which case to take care of first, the order from the top says to take care of Hookah and Alvida threatening the safety of Port Village!%%
So we have decided to concentrate all our effort in catching these guys.
But the strange thing is that they are just wandering around the port and keep getting on our nerves without plundering.%%
It seems that they are acting as if they have been ordered by someone.

I heard you defeated Hookah after meeting Colin. You&#39;re really awesome. 
But I&#39;m already getting worried about him showing up again to disturb the port because you couldn&#39;t catch Hookah and he ran away.%%
My mission is to patrol around the port and I found out that there is a huge amount of bombs that can even blow away 10 ferries.%%
I happened to find Alvida while getting rid of countless buried bombs. I was in the middle of chasing him as he was running away bewildered after he found me while he was planting bombs.%%
Although it would be important to attack into Farrell&#39;s Mansion right away and check the situation because having such purpose is also a problem, it seems that arrogant Alvida is planting bombs around Steven Port perhaps out of revenge against that brat named Hookah.%%
I want to step forward but it is too much to confront Alvida along because I&#39;m merely an average soldier.

Several years ago, people were saying that they saw Paris appear here and there in the Continent of Wind. Some people said she was a young beauty who looks only 17 years old. There were hunters who said they saw her engaged in sorcery and was covered with wolf&#39;s blood at the refuge of gods%%
The most shocking rumor is the incident at Skypie Sanctuary..She created Death Knights with no body. It is horrible just by thinking about it.%%
After that, people no longer call her great hero Paris, but call her {C=0xFF016295/}Witch Paris{C=0xFF4D0D08/}.

On top of that, we are running generators for much longer than before to produce more amount of electricity and there is always lack of electricity. Wouldn&#39;t this drive us crazy?%%

This electricity was flowing toward the direction of Drakos from the swamp where Queen Vella is. Drakos is the area where Elga has been sealed 1000 years ago. Don&#39;t you also know the story that Elga has been unsealed now? %%
We have no idea what they did with electricity they have stolen and it is more fearful that we are not sure at this time whether this incident will come to our Continent of Wind as something unfortunate...%%
And should I say it is the aftermath of Elga... %%Five forces surrounding the earth, people following the force of tree among 5 elements have thrown away their occupation and attached to it.%% Even Anders who is next to me is saying everyone in his family left house and they are not coming back. %%The appearance of new religion when the world is in confusion, wouldn&#39;t this clearly have some sort of bad intention?

While you were in the middle of adventure, I can understand the overall conspiracy of Paris and Elga now. %%
Elga approached Paris through spiritual body leaving his own body which is physically hidden, proposed the contract that never breaks and her desire is cancelling the seal of Elga using her strong magic after being approved as unique and noble being between human beings and dragons as repayment%%
Although Elga recovered her consciousness after waking up from the seal through Paris, she was in a state of not completely recovering a very strong power as before.%%
In order to recover that power, it was making dark crystal stone existing only in theory through the power of Farrell&#39;s science with electrical energy and crystal.%%
Dark crystal stone is something made as the crystal which is dozens of times stronger by absorbing the electrical energy to crystal. Elga is using the power of this strong thousands of dark crystal stones to recover his own power.%%
All these things are conspiracy of Paris that she was preparing one by one from several years ago. Actually, I&#39;m tense with indignation.. %%
It is urgent to keep Elga&#39;s power from getting bigger by recovering dark crystal stone there.%%
Now, even the fact that Paris is also at Elga&#39;s side is the reason that makes us have hard time.%%

Do you know the astronomical amount of money I had to spend to get Billy? %% 
I have no reason to kill Billy!%% Billy was murdered by no one other than Jun!! It was Jun!!%%  
I know why he did something like this!%% Few years ago, I was developing my ideas for the movie. I was also looking for the main character for my movie.%% That&#39;s when I met Billy and Jun. And I had to make my decision on who will have the leading role in the movie.%% I was deep in dilemma. They were equally good in martial arts and acting abilities but I had only one leading role so I had to think it over very carefully.%% I had to audition with them for a month. It was hard to see who was better in terms of their abilities but I chose Billy.%% Why? because it was Billy&#39;s humane qualities. He was very humble and kind to everyone.%% He accepted every criticism with grain of salt, knew what he wasn&#39;t good at and admitted it, and he was also getting fully into his character. But Jun...he was different.%% Humble my ass! He didn&#39;t have the most common courtesy! He beat his manager up and when didn&#39;t like what he saw on the script, he refused to act.%% This is why I chose Billy and Jun cursed me and shouted that he will have his revenge when he left the studio.%% After a while Billy ended up dead! Jun! That punk! He finally messed up big time!%%When Billy was sleeping, he injected animal tranquilizer to his body and ran off! Our employee is the witness. I sent the employee away since Jun might have his revenge on him as well.%% And I had to be in jail for a while since I took the fall. I was in jail for a year and got acquitted and things didn&#39;t go as Jun has planned.%% Jun was afraid that I was out of jail so he started collecting evidence against me. This is when he started using you!%% So you must not believe him! Can&#39;t you trust me? If so, go into this portal."/>

I will tell you the truth. 
My name is Derek and I run this factory over 40 years. 
Foolish old man, has nothing but this factory. %%
As you can see, I need this stick wherever I go. Quite hard to walk alone recently. 
Of course I have clear mind, not mad or anything. %%
I don&#39;t even fear about death. I am old and I know that I will die soon. %%
.....then why I did these things?
I just wanted to clear some unfinished business of mine. %%
I do have large fortune. But I don&#39;t have any kids or friends. 
Well. I feel empty to pass away as I was. Nothing left. All alone. %%
So I came up with an idea of successor for the factory.
To who? To the true lovers of my factory, to one of my factory&#39;s MVP customers! %%
This is truly a great successor, don&#39;t you think so?
Well, but I also wanted to exclude evil ones who are only interested in my money. %%
So I made up with all this plan, only for kids whose souls are still pure and white, far apart from evil spirit of Elga or Paris. %%
As you can see, all the workers in the factory are not human. Maybe you can say that they are monsters. But to run this factory, you cannot fear them but to be one of them. It was a test. I needed transformation magic to test them. %%
But it is all my fault. I think it too simply. %%
I will pay for my bad actions. 
If kids got any kind of harm, I will compensate to them.%%

Did you say that you got curiosity about that tombstone?
Well... it was such a long time ago.%%
Dragons invaded this village in the past.
Of course we took them out of this village so now we can talk like this?%%
This village is established on the blood and the lives of knights who had been dedicated and fought with dragons in the past war.%%
And that tombstone was in memory of Artis, a leader of knights at that time and another two unknown knights who had been awarded one highest honor, so called Lord of Night.%%
Then, as you can see, they have attacked our village but they have previously protected us in the past. 
Someone says, they have seen Artis.%%
Ah...! Is this a village like career soldier&#39;s one?
They are just resurrected ghost.%%
There&#39;s only way to get back them into the ground is.
Burning there stuffs which was loved by themselves!%%
Firstly, I need to make Artis quiet. Artis loved his gloves so much when he was not a ghost so we need to have his gloves.%%
I think two pair of gloves are good enough.
Burn his gloves just right beside of his tombstone.
Then, Artis&#39; ghost will be gone."/>

{C=0xFF4400BB/}I wanted to make human and animals free from an incurable disease through biological way. It will be amazing even we just thought about it! There&#39;s no patient who suffered from a disease, and there will be no one struggle against with a pain... the world must be fulfill of bright and wonderful dream! Then People will not need a God anymore if my dreams come true.
{C=0xFF4400BB/}I was exchanging my opinion with Arcanist Pablo and we researched together beyond on the boarder of science and magic. However, we have met a barrier of research and there&#39;s no more progression in our research project.%%
{C=0xFF4400BB/}Someday, Paris came to me. And she told me that her young and immortality will make people happier, and she agreed my research along with she let me know everything what she got during her entire life such as alchemy, incantation, and many knowledge. Therefore, I finally got over my research barrier by degrees.
{C=0xFF4400BB/}However, I was greedy too much. I researched relentlessly and finally discovered a cell which can control every organism&#39;s birth, old age, sickness, and death. And I discovered the way to control of it. Eventually, I&#39;ve achieved my research that I can control a cell by one simple pill.
{C=0xFF4400BB/}But, I needed to cease my research there. My overcrowded desire was whispering me to challenge a God&#39;s authority. And finally... I found the way to do.
{C=0xFF4400BB/}I shouldn&#39;t have to make a dragon which wasn&#39;t necessary through a toenail of Elga...%%
{C=0xFF4400BB/}I and Paris, we called this organism as Magma Drake Lavalon.
But, suddenly I couldn&#39;t control myself and my memory was so blurry. Is it a side-effect of medicine that I made?%%

The wolves are having issues obtaining food in their area due to fertilization and many other problems. So we haven&#39;t seen a massive amount of wolves lately.%%
However, if they had a very strong leader in their group, things wouldn&#39;t be so bad.
A strong leader to get everyone together is hard to find nowadays.%%
Therefore, a massive number of wolves together with a strong, working wolf can make things better. Then shall we try to find a solution?%%
The wolves are getting together with strong leader?
The solution is simple.
We just slay their leader and they are going to disband easily.
How easy?%%
Fairly easy, but here&#39;s the problem.
According to my genius self, there cannot be a strong wolf out there. Even if there was, there would have to be some sort of mutation. That kind of strength can&#39;t be obtainable!%%
I imagine it like this.
Maybe some kind of creature... such as a human...
turned into a mutant intentionally? Do you like this prediction?%%
Regarding mutants, I&#39;ve got an assumption. I did an autopsy a few weeks ago with dead monster near the town and it had some different fluids inside their body. This is a very interesting issue!%%

Let me explain you something. Dragon Fellowship is an elite group, consisted with powerful but few individuals.

However, recently monsters are showing different patterns. %%
They continuously attacked one point as their target. I mean, our tactical bases. %%
If this is how things will be going from now on, we are having a problem. We cannot defend our key bases because of numerical inferiority neither we cannot attack as usual since it will risk our bases at the back. Understand?%%
We have to solve this situation otherwise we will lost everything in very near future. We need new tactics or new... weapons.. or anything. %%
