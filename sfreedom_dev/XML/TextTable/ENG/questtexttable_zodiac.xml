Flix has gone to Aries to get Golden Sheep. Water spirit Undine has kidnapped his sister Helleta and Flix must bring a Golden Fleece for his sister&#39;s return. 
Flix obtained the Golden Sheep, but has been stopped by Typhoon the Pirate, who is also after the Golden Sheep.

If you save Flix from Typhoon, you can obtain a Golden Fleece, which is the key to enter the Taurus Dungeon.

[Aries Myth]
Legend has it that when King Athamus of Boetia took a second wife, Ino, she was extremely jealous and resentful of his existing children, especially his son, Phrixus. She therefore deviously plotted the failure of the corn crop, intercepted and bribed the messenger sent by her husband to consult an oracle on the matter, and instructed him to say that he had been told that Phrixus had to be sacrificed if the people were to escape starvation. Despite pleadings from the boy&#39;s mother, Nephele, King Athamus agreed to the sacrifice but, at the very last minute, the boy and his sister, Helle, were saved by a magnificent ram with a golden fleece, sent by Zeus in answer to their mother&#39;s prayers. Unfortunately, as the ram crossed the narrow stretch of water between Europe and Asia, Helle fell to her death (the straits are still known as Hellespont) 

Phlixus arrived at Colchis, he sacrificed the sheep to Zeus and gave the Golden Fleece to king of Colchis

Zeus promoted the Sheep to the stars as the Aries constellation ."/>

[Taurus Myth]
Zeus had fallen in love with the beautiful Europa, daughter of King Agenor, as she strolled with her companions on the seashore. He suddenly appeared amongst them as a magnificent white bull, but one which was so gentle that they felt no fear. Europa and her maidens gathered flowers and made garlands which they hung around the animal&#39;s neck and, such was their trust in his docility, that Europa climbed upon his back. However, at this moment, the bull plunged into the sea and swam away furiously with the terrified girl. When they reached Crete, Zeus revealed his true identity and ravished her. Currently it is known that name &#34;Europe&#34; was based from this myth."/>

However due to the recent chaos, Castor has become mentally unstable, causing her twin sister Pollux to suffer the effects as well.

 Fellowship cannot reach Cancer without their help, so you need to help them recover.

[Gemini Myth]
Castor and Pollux (or Polydeuces) were called the Dioscuri, or Sons of Zeus, because Zeus, in the form of a swan, fathered them by Leda. They were closely identified with the city of Sparta, Castor as a renowned horseman and Pollux as a boxer. They sailed with the Argonauts, participated in the Calydonian boar hunt and later helped to rescue their sister Helen of Troy, who had been kidnapped by Thesus and Pirithous.

Finally, in a fight with Idas and Lynceus, whose intended brides Castor and Pollux had kidnapped, Pollux killed Lynceus, but Idas killed Castor and was in turn killed by a thunderbolt of Zeus. Pollux, being immortal, was allowed to share his immortality with Castor, in the heavens as the constellation Gemini."/>

[Cancer Myth]
The story begins with Zeus having an affair with Alcmene, the queen of Tiryns. The result of this union was the Heracles (the Romans named him our familiar Hercules), the most famous Greek Hero. Of course, this union and offspring did not go over too well with Hera, the wife of Zeus. Hera, in her jealous state, swore to kill Hercules. Hera attempted to have Hercules killed many times but his imposing strength allowed him to overcome. Cancer comes into this ‘beloved’ scene when Hercules is fighting the terrible water-serpent, Hydra. During the battle between Heracles and Hydra, Hera sent Cancer, the giant crab, to aid the serpent. As the violent fight took place, Cancer was nipping at Hercules feet. But Heracles, being so mighty in strength, killed the crab by smashing its shell with his foot. Hera then placed the crab&#39;s image in the night sky as a reward for it’s service."/>

[Leo Myth]
The story is about the Nemean lion which Hercules had to kill as the first of his 12 Labours. This fearsome beast terrorised the land, killing all who ventured near it. Not only was it more fierce, larger and stronger than other lions, but it also had the added advantage of possessing a skin which was impervious to metal, stone and wood. Since, for this reason, Hercules could not kill the lion with any weapon, he wrestled it with his bare hands, and finally managed to strangle the animal. Seeing at once the unique protective qualities of the pelt, he removed it with one of the lion&#39;s own claws, and thereafter wore it as a cloak."/>

[Pegasus Myth]
The white, winged horse Pegasus was the offspring of Poseidon and the Gorgon , Medusa, springing from the latter&#39;s neck when she was killed by Perseus. He immediately flew to Mount Helicon and struck the ground with his hoof. The resulting stream which flowed from the spot he had pawed became sacred to the Muses. Some time later Pegasus was to help Perseus to rescue Andromeda from the dreadful sea monster Cetus.

Bellerophon, the grandson of Sisyphus (a selfish man punished by the Gods for his arrogance by being forced to continually push an enormous boulder to the top of a hill, only for it to roll back down just as the goal seemed within reach) was also greatly aided by Pegasus when undertaking several dangerous missions, including his fight against the Chimaera, the three-headed monstrous female. However, the success of this and other missions turned Bellerophon&#39;s head and he, too, became arrogant. So much so, that although a mere mortal, he forced Pegasus to fly him to Mount Olympus, the home of the Gods. Zeus , greatly annoyed at Bellerophon&#39;s presumption that he was worthy to be in such august company, sent an insect to bite Pegasus on his flank, causing him to rear up and throw Bellerophon to the ground. He was then dispatched back to earth, and ended his days a sad and lonely figure, blind and lame. For Pegasus, however, there was the reward of a place in the stables on Mount Olympus, and the opportunity to carry around Zeus&#39;s thunderbolts"/>

 However sea serpent has three head, and it&#39;s head will keep spawn again.
 However its middle head has its weakness. So use the weakness and get the key.

[Hydra Myth]
Hercules was born between Zeus and a human. Zeus&#39;s wife Hera hated Hercules and ordered King Eurystheus to make Hercules to perform 12 difficult tasks. One of them was to defeat Immortal Hydra.
Hercules went to battle with his cousin Iolaus. Hercules found out that every time he cut off a Hydra&#39;s head, it keep growing back, so it was impossible to kill it. Iolaus used a torch to burn out the position where Hercules has cut off, as result the head stop growing back and the Hercules able to defeat Hydra. Hercules dig up a hole and put the last Hydra&#39;s head and placed a large rock over it.

In honor of the victory, Zeus took the Hydra&#39;s head and make a star sign."/>
